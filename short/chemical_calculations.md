# Basics of chemical calculations

## Prerequisite knowledge
We assume that you have prerequisite knowledge about basic chemistry and are familiar with concenpts such as the [periodic table of elements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Periodic_table). We also assume that you are familiar with basic chemical calculations but as a reminder we will repeat some of the most important basics below:

## Avogadro constant
The Avogadro constant is a numeric value expressed as a dimensionless number that represents the number of particles that are contained in one mole:  

$Avogadro\ constant = 6.02214076 \cdot 10^{23}$

## Molecular weight 
The molecular weight of a molecule can be calculated by adding up the atomic mass of the individual atoms.
For example, water ($H_2O$) contains two hydrogen atoms and 1 oxygen atom. The molecular weigth can be calculated as $2 * 1.008 + 15.999 =  18.015\ g/mol$. The unit is g/mol.

## From mass to mole
You can convert mass to mole using the following formula:

$n = \frac{m}{M_w}$

Where `n` represents mole, `m` represents mass and `Mw` represents the molecular weight.

Example:

How many moles are in 1 gram of water?

$n = \frac{m}{M_w} = \frac{1}{18.015} =0.0555 \ moles$

## Calculation the concentration of a solution
You van calculate the concentration of a solution in mole per volume by using the following formula:

$c = \frac{n}{V}$

Where `c` represents the concentration, `n` represents the number of moles and `V` represents the volume.

Concentration can also be calculated as mass per volume:

$c = \frac{m}{V}$

Where `c` represents the concentration, `m` represents the mass and `V` represents the volume.

## Calculation the amount required from a stock solution
If you want to make a dilluted solution from a stock solution, you can calculate the required amount from the stock solution using the following formula:

$c_1 \cdot V_1 = c_2 \cdot V_2$

Where `c1` represents the concentration of the stock solution, `V1` represents the volume of the stock solution, `c2` represents the concentration of the dilluted solution and `V2` represents the volume of the dilluted solution.

Example:

Imagine you have a stock of 1 mol/L and you want 500 ml of 150 mmol/L.  
How much of the stock solution do you need?  

$c_1 \cdot V_1 = c_2 \cdot V_2$
Thus:
$1000 \cdot V_1 = 150 \cdot 500$
Thus:
$V_1 = \frac{150 \cdot 500}{1000} = 75 \ mL$
