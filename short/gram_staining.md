# Gram staining of *Escherichia coli* and *Staphylococcus epidermidis*

## Learning outcomes
- Work with micro-organisms bacteria
- Apply a staining method
- Basic use of the microscope

## Introduction and principle
The Gram stain is a method of staining bacteria. In addition to staining bacterial cells, it can be used to distinguish between gram-positive bacteria and gram-negative bacteria. Gram staining is often the first step in the identification of a bacterial species. The Gram stain differentiates Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria by the thickness of the peptidoglycan layer. Gram-positive cells will retain crystal violet (purple color) while in Gram-negative cells the crystal violet will wash out on addition of ethanol. The Gram-negative cells are counter stained by fuchsine (red color).

## Assay
1. Draw a circle on a microscopic slide glass using a pencil and add your initials using a scratch pen. Use two slides (one for each bacterial strain) 
2. Take a very small amount from a colony and suspend in isotonic salt solution. (circa $2\ cm^2$). Be carefull not to spill bacteria!
2. Let the sample dry.
3. Fixate for 5 minutes in 96% ethanol.
4. Stain for 1 minute in crystal violet.
5. Wash in tap water and dispose excess water on a paper towel.
6. Stain with lugol for 1 minute.
7. Wash with ethanol 96%.
8. Incubate for 1 minute in ethanol 96%.
9. Wash in tap water and dispose excess water on a paper towel.
10. Stain for 1 minute with fuchsine.
11. Wash with tap water.
12. Dry the slide in paper towel.
13. Examine the slide under a light microscope. Start with a 10x objective lens. Then increase to 40x and finally 100x objective lens using immersion oil. 

## Processing lab data

- If all looks well, use a microscope with camera to take pictures for your lab journal.
- Report your observations in eLabjournal.
